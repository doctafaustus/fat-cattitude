# Fat Cattitude
<p>Thereâ€™s attitude and thereâ€™s <b><i>cattitude</i></b>â€”and Fat Cattitude has a lot of both. Weâ€™ve also got t-shirts, mugs, stickers, and hats with cats on them. What more could you want? Paw through our products to see which one (or four) you like.</p>

<p>At Fat Cattitude, we donâ€™t take ourselves too seriously, and you shouldnâ€™t either. Weâ€™re just here to spread the love of all things cat and have a good laugh (and coerce you to life a Fat Cat Lifestyle ðŸ˜º).</p>

<p>So if you like memes and cats, youâ€™re in the right place. If you donâ€™t like either, please get off of the internet.</p>
